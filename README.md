Jira Exporter
========================

Jira Exporter is a Chrome plugin that translates Jira tickets into Evernote notes. This application is a work in progress.

Setup
--------
1. While I wait on OAuth application approval from Evernote, we can still use [Evernote developer tokens](http://dev.evernote.com/start/core/authentication.php#devtoken). Get a developer token from Evernote [here](https://www.evernote.com/Login.action?targetUrl=%2Fapi%2FDeveloperToken.action).
2. Clone the project / pull source.
3. Edit popup.js and enter the developer token you got from Evernote.
4. Load Chrome.
5. In Chrome go to Settings > Extensions.
6. Check "Developer mode" in the upper-right of Chrome.
7. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and choose the root of the folder in which you placed the clone of the repository.
8. If all went well you now should have a plugin button in the upper-right of the page. Click it! Enjoy!
